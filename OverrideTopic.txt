Method Overriding means:

Child class provides its own implementation of a method that is already present in the parent class.

 Same method name
 Same parameters
 Different class (parent → child)

Definition :

When a subclass redefines a parent class method with the same signature, it is called Method Overriding.

Why Method Overriding is Needed
Method overriding is used to:

Achieve runtime polymorphism
Change parent class behavior
Implement dynamic method dispatch
Provide specific implementation




Real-Life Example
Bank system:
Bank → rateOfInterest()
SBI → 7%
HDFC → 8%
Same method name, different implementations.


Conditions / Rules for Method Overriding :

 Inheritance must be present
 Method name must be same
 Parameter list must be same
 IS-A relationship
 Access modifier cannot be more restrictive
 Return type must be same (or covariant)


syntax for method Overriding :


class Parent {
    void show() {
        // parent code
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    void show() {
        // child code
    }
}





Difference: Overloading vs Overriding :

Overloading	         Overriding
Same class	         Different class
Compile-time	         Runtime
Parameters differ	 Parameters same
No inheritance needed	 Inheritance required






Advantages of Method Overriding

Runtime flexibility
Code reusability
Loose coupling
Better maintainability
