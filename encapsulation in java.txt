Encapsulation is a process of binding data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit (class) and controlling access to the data using access modifiers.

✔ Data Hiding
✔ Data Security
✔ Controlled Access
✔ Achieved by Private Variables + Public Getters/Setters

Real life example : Medicine Capsule 



why Encapsulation :

To hide sensitive data from outside world
To protect data from unauthorized access
To provide a controlled way to access/modify data
Reduces error – improves security
Helps in writing clean, maintainable code



How Encapsulation Works?

Encapsulation = private variables + public getters & setters

private → restricts direct access
getter() → only returns value
setter() → sets value with validation (business logic)




syntax : 



class ClassName {

    // 1. private data members
    private datatype variableName;

    // 2. public getter method
    public datatype getVariableName() {
        return variableName;
    }

    // 3. public setter method
    public void setVariableName(datatype variableName) {
        this.variableName = variableName;
    }
}





Example : 




class Student {
    private int id;
    private String name;

    public int getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId(int id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}










7. Advantages of Encapsulation : 

Data hiding → Secure data
Code flexibility → getter/setter control access
Improved maintainability
Better security
Easy debugging and testing


note : Encapsulation is a technique in Java where we make variables private and provide public getter and setter methods to access and modify them safely.









practise Questions  :





1. Create a class with private variables

Question:
Create a class Person with private variables name and age.
Add setter and getter methods.
Create an object and print the name and age.

2. Bank Account – deposit & withdraw

Question:
Create a BankAccount class with a private balance.
Add:
deposit(double amount)
withdraw(double amount)
getBalance()
