Serialisation in java : 

Serialization is the process of converting an object into a byte stream so that it can be stored in a file, sent over a network, or saved for future use.
The reverse process is called Deserialization.

Serialization is used when:
Object data needs to be saved permanently
Object needs to be transferred between JVMs
Application is restarted and object state must be restored


How Serialization Works in Java : 

The class must implement Serializable interface
Java provides :
ObjectOutputStream → Serialization
ObjectInputStream → Deserialization
Serializable is a marker interface (no methods)
