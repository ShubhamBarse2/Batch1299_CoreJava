 
Access Specifiers(Modifiers) : 


What is an Access Specifier?

Access Specifier in Java is used to control the visibility (accessibility) of classes, variables, methods, and constructors.



Types of Access Specifiers

Java has 4 access specifiers:

 public
 protected
 default
 private




1> public

Accessible from anywhere
Across class, package, project
Most open access level
Used for: API, library methods, model classes



2> private

Accessible only within the same class
Not visible to other classes
Supports encapsulation
Used for: data hiding (variables in OOPS)



3> protected

Accessible within:
same class
same package
subclass of other package (via inheritance)
Used for: inheritance-based programs


4> default 

If no specifier is written
Accessible only in same package
Also called package-private
Used for: package-level implementation

 




Important Rules : 

Class can be only public or default
Class cannot be private or protected
Members (variables/methods) can use all four
private supports encapsulation
protected supports inheritance





imp code reference : 

public class Demo {   //   Outer class    // public & default
	
	
	private class D  {     // Inner class // public , private , default , protected
		
	}

}
