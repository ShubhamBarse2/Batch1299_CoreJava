supposed if you want to handled the Exception so we have option

}




System.out.println(4 / 2); // 2
		System.out.println(6 / 2); // 3
		try {
			System.out.println(4 / 0); // stop
		} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
			System.out.println("Divide by zero Not Allowed ... !");
		} finally {
			System.out.println("i am in finally blocked : always Executable ... !");
		}
		System.out.println(8 / 2);
		System.out.println(16 / 2); // 8







try {
