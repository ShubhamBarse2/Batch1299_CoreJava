
*) ALTER :

The ALTER TABLE statement is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table.
The ALTER TABLE statement is also used to add and drop various constraints on an existing table.


1) Add a new column              : ALTER TABLE employee ADD country varchar(50);
2) Modify an existing column     : ALTER TABLE employee MODIFY mob_numb int;
3) Drop a column                 : ALTER TABLE employee DROP COLUMN email;
4) Rename a column               : ALTER TABLE employee RENAME COLUMN email TO gmail;
5) Rename a table                : ALTER TABLE employee RENAME TO employeeRecord;


*) ORDER BY :

The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending
 order.
The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the
 records in descending order, use the DESC keyword.

for Ascending order use : ASC
for Descending order use : DESC

select * from employeerecord ORDER BY salary ASC;

select * from employeerecord ORDER BY salary DESC;


*) LIMIT & OFFSET :

#) LIMIT clause is used to specify the number of records to return.
  The LIMIT clause is useful on large tables with thousands of records.
  Returning a large number of records can impact performance.

SELECT * FROM Employee 
LIMIT 3;


#) What if we want to select records 4 - 6 (inclusive)?
  MySQL provides a way to handle this: by using OFFSET.
  The SQL query below says "return only 3 records, start on record 4 (OFFSET 3)" :

SELECT * FROM Employee
LIMIT 3 OFFSET 3;



*) COMMENTS :

*) Single Line Comments :

Single line comments start with --.
Any text between -- and the end of the line will be ignored (will not be executed).


 -- WHERE City='Berlin';


*) Multi-line Comments :

Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.
Any text between /* and */ will be ignored.


/*Select all the columns
of all the records
in the Employee table:*/



*) ALIASES :

Aliases are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name.
Aliases are often used to make column names more readable.
An alias only exists for the duration of that query.
An alias is created with the AS keyword.

Query : SELECT email AS employee_email FROM employeerecord;



*) AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS :

An aggregate function is a function that performs a calculation on a set of values, and returns a single value.
Aggregate functions are often used with the GROUP BY clause of the SELECT statement. The GROUP BY clause splits the result-set into groups of values and the aggregate function can be used to return a single value for each group.

The most commonly used SQL aggregate functions are:

Aggregate functions ignore null values (except for COUNT()). 

MIN()   : The MIN() function returns the smallest value of the selected column.
MAX()   : The MAX() function returns the largest value of the selected column.
COUNT() : The COUNT() function returns the number of rows that matches a specified criterion.
AVG()   : The AVG() function returns the average value of a numeric column. 
SUM()   : The SUM() function returns the total sum of a numeric column. 

 Note: NULL values are ignored.
