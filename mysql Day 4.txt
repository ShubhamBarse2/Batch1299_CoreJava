
*) LIKE OPERATOR :

The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

The percent sign (%) represents zero, one, or multiple characters
The underscore sign (_) represents one, single character
The percent sign and the underscore can also be used in combinations!

LIKE Syntax

Query : SELECT * FROM empdata WHERE name LIKE 'a%';


WHERE Name LIKE 's%'	Finds any values that start with "s"
WHERE Name LIKE '%h'	Finds any values that end with "a"
WHERE Name LIKE '%sh%'	Finds any values that have "sh" in any position
WHERE Name LIKE '_a%'	Finds any values that have "a" in the second position
WHERE Name LIKE 's_%'	Finds any values that start with "s" and are at least 2 characters in length
WHERE Name LIKE 's__%'	Finds any values that start with "s" and are at least 3 characters in length
WHERE Name LIKE 's%m'	Finds any values that start with "s" and ends with "m"


*) IN OPERATOR : 

The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause.
The IN operator is a shorthand for multiple OR conditions.


Query : SELECT * FROM empdata WHERE State IN ('maharashtra', 'up', 'mp');

Query : SELECT * FROM empdata WHERE State NOT IN ('mp', 'up');


*) BETWEEN OPERATOR : 

The BETWEEN operator selects values within a given range. The values can be numbers, text, or dates.
The BETWEEN operator is inclusive: begin and end values are included.


Query : SELECT * FROM employeerecord WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20;

Query : SELECT * FROM employeerecord WHERE age NOT BETWEEN 100 AND 200;


*) AUTO INCREMENT : 

Auto-increment allows a unique number to be generated automatically when a new record is inserted into a table.
Often this is the primary key field that we would like to be created automatically every time a new record is inserted.

MySQL uses the AUTO_INCREMENT keyword to perform an auto-increment feature.
By default, the starting value for AUTO_INCREMENT is 1, and it will increment by 1 for each new record.

*) DATE DATA TYPE : 

DATE         - format YYYY-MM-DD            = 2024-12-23
DATETIME     - format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS  =  2024-09-26 12:25:14 
TIMESTAMP    - format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS
YEAR         - format YYYY or YY            = 2024 or 24


*) UNIQUE KEY CONSTRAINT :

The UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column are different.
Both the UNIQUE and PRIMARY KEY constraints provide a guarantee for uniqueness for a column or set of columns.
A PRIMARY KEY constraint automatically has a UNIQUE constraint.
However, you can have many UNIQUE constraints per table, but only one PRIMARY KEY constraint per table.


Query : CREATE TABLE student( stud_id int auto_increment primary key, name varchar(40), bench_no int UNIQUE ,sjoin_date DATE);

Query : insert into student(name,bench_no,sjoin_date) values('om',12,'2024-09-23');

Query : ALTER TABLE student AUTO_INCREMENT = 101;
