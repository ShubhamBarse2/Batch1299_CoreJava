static is a keyword in Java that means:
The member (variable / method / block) belongs to the class, not to the object.

That means:
Only one copy is created in memory.
We can access it without creating an object.
It loads when the class is loaded into memory.



Where can we use static?

Place           	Meaning

static variable  	Common/shared value for all objects
static method	        Method called without object
static block	        Runs only once when class loads
static class (nested)	Inner class which can be accessed without object




Practise Questions : 

Create a class Student with:
static variable → collegeName
non-static → id, name
method to display details
Create 3 objects and show how collegeName is same for all.


Create a class Bank:
static variable: rateOfInterest
static method to change ROI
non-static method to display account balance + ROI
Call methods and observe behavior.



Create program:
