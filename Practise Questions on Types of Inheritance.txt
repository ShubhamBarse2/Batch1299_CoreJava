
Practise Questions on types of Inheritance in java :  

1.Create class A with method showA() and class B extending A with method showB().
Call both methods using object of B.

2.Create class Parent with variable x = 10.
Create class Child extending Parent with variable y = 20.
Print both values using object of Child.

3.Create class Animal with method eat().
Create class Dog extending Animal with method bark().
Call both methods.

4.Create class Vehicle with method start().
Create class Car extending Vehicle with method drive().
Call both using child object.

5.Create class A with variable a = 100.
Class B extends A and doubles the value: b = a * 2.
Print both values.

6.Create classes A → B → C.
Each class has one method:
A.showA(), B.showB(), C.showC().
Call all three using C object.

7.Create classes GrandParent → Parent → Child.
Each class has one variable:
a=1, b=2, c=3.
Print all values using object of Child.

8.Create Vehicle → Car → SportsCar.
Each class prints a message.
Create object of SportsCar and show all messages.

9.Create a chain LivingThing → Animal → Dog.
Add one method in each class and call all using Dog object.

10.Create classes X → Y → Z.
Z contains method display() that prints variable from all three classes.

11.Create class Parent with method p().
Create two child classes Child1 and Child2.
Call methods of all classes using objects of each child.

12.Create class Shape with variable type.
Child classes: Circle, Square.
Each child prints its own type.

13.Create base class Animal.
Child classes: Dog, Cat.
Both children print a different message.

14.Create base class A with method m1().
Child classes B and C with methods m2() and m3().
Test both child classes.

15.Create class Person.
Child classes: Student, Teacher.
Each child has an additional variable.
Print parent and child variables using child objects.


16.Create class structure:
A → B, A → C, and C → D.
Write simple methods in each and call using object of D.

17.Create class structure:

       Animal
       /    \
   Dog      Cat
             |
           Tiger


Add one method in each class and call all methods using Tiger object.

18.Create class structure:
College → Teacher and College → Student → Monitor.
Write separate methods for each class and test using Monitor object.

19.
Create classes A → B → C.
Each class has a different integer variable.
Add a method in class C to print all three variables.

20.Create parent class Device.
Child classes: Mobile, Laptop.
Each child class defines one method.
