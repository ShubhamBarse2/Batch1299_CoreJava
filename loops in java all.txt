LOOPS IN JAVA

1. Introduction

Loops are used when we want to execute a block of code multiple times.
Helps reduce code duplication and improves logic flow.
Key idea : repeat a task until a condition becomes false.

. Why Loops Are Needed :
“If you want to print ‘Hello’ 100 times, will you write 100 print statements"
No — that’s why loops exist.


3. Types of Loops in Java :

(A) Entry-Controlled Loops
for loop
while loop

(B) Exit-Controlled Loop
do-while loop

(upcoming topic)
(C) Enhanced Loop
for-each loop (Used for arrays and collections)




1) for loop syntax :

for(initialization; condition; updation) {
    // code
}

ex : 

for(int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}



2) while loop syntax : 

while(condition) {
    // code
}

ex : 

int i = 1;
while(i <= 5) {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
}



3) do - while loop syntax : 

do {
    // code
} while(condition);


ex : 

int i = 1;
do {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
} while(i <= 5);






Practise Questions on Loops : 


Print numbers from 1 to 10 using a loop.
Print numbers from 10 to 1.
Print all even numbers between 1 and 50.
Print all odd numbers between 1 and 50.
Print the table of 5 using a loop.
Print the table of any number (e.g., n = 7).
Print Hello 10 times.
Print the sum of first 10 natural numbers.
Print the sum of even numbers from 1 to 100.
Print the sum of odd numbers from 1 to 100.
