

The final keyword in Java is used to restrict modification. Once something is declared as final, it cannot be changed, overridden, or inherited, depending on where it is applied. It is mainly used to provide security, consistency, and reliability in a program.




Where We Can Apply final Keyword
The final keyword can be applied to:

Variables
Methods
Classes



1. final Variable
Meaning:

A variable declared as final becomes a constant.
Its value cannot be changed once assigned.
Key Points:
Must be initialized once
Value cannot be modified
Used for fixed values
Commonly used with static → static final



  final double pi = 3.14;




2. final Method
Meaning:

A method declared as final cannot be overridden by child classes.

Key Points:
Used to prevent method overriding
Inheritance is allowed, but modification is not
Improves security and performance





3. final Class
Meaning:

A class declared as final cannot be inherited.
Key Points:
No child class allowed
Used when behavior should not be changed
Provides complete security







Interview Important Points :

final variable must be initialized once
final method prevents overriding
final class prevents inheritance
static final is used for constants
final improves security and clarity







super vs this  : 


this	                                      super
Refers to current class object	        Refers to parent class object
Access current class members	        Access parent class members
Calls current class constructor   	Calls parent class constructor


by using this and super keyword we can call : 

global variables 
methods 
and Constructor Rule : first statement in other Constructor
