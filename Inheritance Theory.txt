Inheritance (IS-A Relationship) in java :
 
Inheritance is a core concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) where one class acquires the properties (variables) and behaviors (methods) of another class.

It provides code reusability
Helps in building real-world relationships
Supports method overriding (polymorphism)


2. Why Do We Need Inheritance?
To avoid writing duplicate code
To create hierarchical (parent–child) structures
To extend and modify existing code
To achieve runtime polymorphism
To improve maintainability of code

Example:
Dog IS-A Animal
Car IS-A Vehicle
Student IS-A Person






Term	                          Meaning
Superclass / Parent class	The class whose properties are inherited
Subclass / Child class	        The class that inherits properties
extends keyword	                Used to perform inheritance
IS-A relationship	        Relationship between parent & child


syntax : 

class Parent {
    // variables
    // methods
}

class Child extends Parent {
    // child-specific variables
    // child-specific methods
}
