
Practise Problems :

1. Create a class Student with private variables:
id, name, percentage.
Use encapsulation (getters & setters)
Use constructor and this to initialize values
Take input using Scanner
Print student details



2.Create parent class Person (name, age).
Create child class Employee (salary).
Call parent constructor using super()
Child should print all details
Create one object and display data


3.Create class Calculator with methods add():
add(int a, int b)
add(int a, int b, int c)
add(double a, double b)
Take values using Scanner and show results.


4.Create class Animal with method sound().
Create child classes Dog and Cat.
Override sound()
Call methods using parent reference



5. Book (encapsulation)
id, title, author (private)
User (parent)
StudentUser (child)
abstract class LibraryActions → issueBook(), returnBook()
interface Display → showDetails()
Requirements:
Use constructor to set book details
Use Scanner to take user details
Override methods where required
Use final variable LATE_FEE
Use this and super


6. Create parent class A with constructor.
Create child class B.
Use this() to call another constructor in same class
Use super() to call parent constructor
Print messages to see order of execution



7. Create class Address (city, state).
Create class Employee (id, name) which has-a Address.
Take details using Scanner
Print employee along with address
(Shows object inside object)



8. Create class Vehicle:

final variable MAX_SPEED = 120
final method start()
Create child class Car and try to override start()
Observe and explain compiler error
Also try assigning new value to MAX_SPEED.



9. Create:

abstract class Course → courseName, duration, abstract method fees()
class DegreeCourse and DiplomaCourse (override fees())
Student → id, name, HAS-A Course
final double REGISTRATION_FEE = 1000
Requirements:
Take student & course details using Scanner.
Choose course type dynamically (runtime polymorphism)
Total Fee = fees() + REGISTRATION_FEE
Try to change REGISTRATION_FEE and observe compile-time error.
Print complete student + course summary.



10 . Create the following classes:

Patient → id, name, age
Doctor → id, name, specialization
Room → roomNo, type
Hospital → HAS-A (Patient, Doctor, Room)
Requirements:
A Hospital object should store multiple patients.
Take all details using Scanner.
If patient age < 12 → assign “Child Specialist”
If patient age ≥ 60 → print “Senior Citizen Priority”
Print full report:
Patient + Doctor + Room
