
What is an Abstract Class?

An abstract class in Java is a class that cannot be instantiated (object cannot be created) and is used to achieve partial abstraction.
It may contain:
Abstract methods (methods without body)
Concrete methods (methods with body)
Variables
Constructors

 Abstract class is declared using the abstract keyword.


Why Do We Need an Abstract Class?
To hide implementation details
To provide a common base class
To force child classes to implement specific methods
To achieve partial abstraction (0–100%)
Real-life idea:
A blueprint – not complete, but gives structure.




Syntax of Abstract Class : 

abstract class ClassName {
    abstract void method1();   // abstract method
    void method2() {            // concrete method
        // implementation
    }
}





Abstract Method :
Declared using abstract
No method body
Ends with a semicolon ;
Must be implemented by child class
abstract void display();



Rules of Abstract Class (Very Important)

Cannot create object of abstract class
 new AbstractClass();
Can contain abstract and non-abstract methods
Can have constructors
Can have instance variables and static variables
If a class contains at least one abstract method, the class must be abstract
Child class must override all abstract methods, otherwise child must also be abstract
Abstract class can extend another abstract class




Constructor in Abstract Class :
✔ Allowed
✔ Used to initialize variables





When to Use Abstract Class?

When classes are closely related
When you want to share code
When some methods are common and some must be implemented by child
When you need constructors or instance variables
