Multithreading :  

Multi threading  is an process where we can executes multiple threads at simultaneously / same times 

Thread is an small piece of code
also it is an inbuild class in java which is present in java.lang package 

multi threading can be achieved by two ways : 
trough 

1> Thread class 
2> Runnable Interface 


to create an thread we have two methods which is provided by Thread class 

1> run     
2> start


1> Functional Interface : 

--> it contains only one abstract method
--> it has Annotated base as (@FunctionalInterface)

2> Marker Interface :

--> it has Empty Interface
--> it doesn't contains any methods or (any Members)






ref code : 




package com.thread;

public class MyThread extends Thread {

	
	public void run() {

		for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
			System.out.println("myThread " + i);
			try {
				Thread.sleep(500);
			} catch (InterruptedException e) {
				e.printStackTrace();
			}
		}
	}

	public void m1() {
		for (int i = 111; i <= 200; i++) {
			System.out.println("m1 logic  " + i);
			try {
				Thread.sleep(1000);
			} catch (InterruptedException e) {
				e.printStackTrace();
			}
		}

	}

}



 




package com.thread;

public class MainClass {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		MyThread t = new MyThread();
		t.start(); // it calls run method
		t.m1();

	}

}
