
Collection Framework : 

The Collection Framework is a set of interfaces and classes that provides ready-made data structures and methods to store, retrieve, manipulate, and process objects efficiently.

main Components of Collection Framework : (Collection,List,Set,Queue,Map,ArryList,Vector,HashSet,TreeSet .. etc)


Generics in Collection Frameworks : 

Generics is a feature introduced in Java 5 that allows a class, interface, or method to operate on objects of a specified data type, providing type safety and eliminating the need for type casting.
Generics enable type-safe programming by allowing parameterized types, ensuring compile-time type checking.

Simple Example
ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();

note : only String type of Data can be accept : 



Legacy Classes in java : 


Legacy classes are the classes that were introduced in earlier versions of Java (before Java 1.2) and are not part of the Collection Framework but still exist for backward compatibility.
Legacy classes are older Java classes that were available before the Collection Framework and are maintained for backward compatibility.

Examples of Legacy Classes:

Vector
Stack
Hashtable
Enumeration



Defrn betn Array & ArrayList(Collection) : 

         Array  


Feature	             Array	                Collection(ArrayList)

Size	             Fixed	                    Dynamic
Data type	     Same data type	          Objects only
Flexibility	     Less	                     More
Built-in methods     Very few	                     Many
Part of	             Java language	         java.util package
Usage	             Simple data storage	Real-time applications 


note : Array is a fixed-size data structure for storing similar type elements, whereas the Collection Framework provides dynamic, flexible data structures with built-in methods to manage a group of objects.
         




Collection & Collections : 

Collection is an interface used to store objects, whereas Collections is a utility class that provides methods to manipulate collection objects.

1. Maintain Insertion Orders
2. Duplicates allowed
3. n no Null Accepted 
4. Maintain Index 
5. get index Specific
 

Set(I)

HashSet
TreeSet(Sorting Possible , NULL not Allowed)
LinkedHashSet(Maintain Insertion Order) 

1. cant Maintain Insertion Orders
2. Duplicates Not allowed
3. only one Null Accepted(HashSet, LinkedHashSet)
4. doesn't Maintain Index 
5. cant get index Specific
